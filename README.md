For these scripts works, you need to create an API on your HYCU account.
I invite you to check how to on google.


These 2 scripts allow to check : 
- Hycu Target
- backup status on hycu

For Hycu Target, the script check if target are available

Just modify this part (hycu host and api): 
HYCU_HOST = "xxxxx"
API_TOKEN = "xxxxxx"


For the backup status, its same modifications
